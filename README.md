# hackathon - getting to know each other application

## Problem
* People don't know what Goldman Sachs is and does.
* People don't finish their application after scanning QR code or talking to a recruiter.

## Goal
* Increase the ratio of number of people applying to people talking with recruiters.
* Encourage people to apply.
* Make the application process more interesting.

## Solution
* Web application on an iPad on the GS stand and QR code to run it on mobile.
* Make the application process easier by dividing it in two parts: filling the form in the app and finishing it at home (people will get a link to partly filled form by email).
* Intertwining mini games (with trivia about GS) with filling out the form to make it more fun.
* People get merch prizes after submitting the form by the app or talking with a recruiter,
* The prizes are picked by the score that the person got in the app (the prizes will be chosen based on the distribution of the scores - the coolest gadgets are reserved for scores in 80th percentile...).

## Impact
* Getting more people to apply to GS.
* Getting data about people interested in working at GS.
* The data could be used to tailor the experience at the stand at the same event next year (if people at given faculty are interested in technology A, but not interested in technology B at all, then more emloyees working with A (than the ones working with B) should attend the event). 

## Creativity and innovation
* The system would be benefitial for GS and potential candidates.
* It would be more fun and engaging to apply this way.
* GS could collect data about potential candidates, report, analize it and profile the candidates.

## Possible further development
### Mini game ideas
* Pick hex code of the blue color in GS logo (with rating).
* Draw the logo of Goldman Sachs.
* Pick countries in which GS has offices.
* Estimate how many people does Goldman Sachs employ (8 tries with feedback: less/more).
* What is Goldman Sachs?
* Pick the technologies that you know and we'll tell you what role is perfect for you.
* Pick the technologies that you know and we'll tell you which of them are used in GS.

### Questions
* What's your graduation year and month?
* What's your sex, ethnicity, city, university, area of study, current degree?
* What's your top 1 technology?
* Do you plan to continue studying after finishing current degree? 
* What inspired you to apply?
